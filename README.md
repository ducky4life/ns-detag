# ns-detag
**works with fast.nationstates.net :D**

Extra detag functionalities i guess. idk javascript (pls ignore my shit code)

this is meant to be used on top of existing update tools such as breeze++ or gauntlet, thats why i chose keybinds that these scripts dont/rarely use

i pieced this together by pattern recognition and sampling different ns scripts, i dont know js

you can change the keybind by replacing L/O in keyL/keyO/etc with another key of your choice

# Installation
I use TamperMonkey for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [script.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-detag/raw/main/script.js) (or paste it in your script runner), optionally change keybinds, run it, enjoy

# Functionalities

## Governor rename (defaults to L)

first button press takes you to https://www.nationstates.net/page=regional_officer/region/office=governor/ if you are not there
 
second one replaces current gov name with the default one and immediately renames it, no submit button required

## Eyebeast (defaults to O)

Takes you to the [Eyebeast](https://eyebeast.calref.ca) page of the current region page

only works if you are on a region page
