# ns-detag
**works with fast.nationstates.net :D**

this is meant to be used on top of existing update tools such as breeze++ or gauntlet, thats why i chose keybinds that these scripts dont/rarely use

you can change the keybind by replacing L/O in KeyL/KeyO/etc with another key of your choice

i pieced this together by pattern recognition and sampling different ns scripts, i dont know js

# Installation
I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [script.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-detag/raw/main/script.js) (or paste it in your script runner), optionally change keybinds, run it, enjoy

[Latest Release](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-detag/releases/latest), read the changelogs here

# Functionalities

## Governor rename (defaults to L)

First button press takes you to https://www.nationstates.net/page=regional_officer/region/office=governor/ if you are not there (works with fast.nationstates.net)
 
Second one replaces current gov name with the default one and immediately renames it, no confirmation required

## Eyebeast (defaults to O)

Takes you to the [Eyebeast](https://eyebeast.calref.ca) page of the current region page (only works if you are on a region page)

## Toggle template (defaults to K)

Toggles between the template-overall=none version of current page

This feature is the same as the Breeze++ and Gauntlet feature, for my Reliant homies

## Toggle fast (defaults to I)

Toggles between the fast.nationstates.net version of current page
