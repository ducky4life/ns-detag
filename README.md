# ns-detag
### works with fast.nationstates.net :D
Extra detag functionalities i guess. idk javascript

i pieced this together by pattern recognition and sampling different ns scripts, i dont know js

you can change the keybind by replacing L/O in keyL/keyO/etc with another key of your choice

# Installation
I use TamperMonkey for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [script.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-detag/raw/main/script.js), run it, enjoy

# Functionalities

### Governor rename (defaults to L)

first button press takes you to https://www.nationstates.net/page=regional_officer/region/office=governor/ if you are not there
 
second one replaces current gov name with the default one and immediately renames it, no submit button required

### Eyebeast (defaults to O)

Takes you to the [Eyebeast](https://eyebeast.calref.ca) page of the current region page

only works if you are on a region page
